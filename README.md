# Hierarchical_Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is one of the popular and easy to understand clustering technique. This clustering technique is divided into two types: Agglomerative &amp; Divisive.

Agglomerative Clustering: Also known as bottom-up approach or hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). A structure that is more informative than the unstructured set of clusters returned by flat clustering. This clustering algorithm does not require us to prespecify the number of clusters. Bottom-up algorithms treat each data as a singleton cluster at the outset and then successively agglomerates pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data.

Divisive clustering : Also known as top-down approach. This algorithm also does not require to prespecify the number of clusters. Top-down clustering requires a method for splitting a cluster that contains the whole data and proceeds by splitting clusters recursively until individual data have been splitted into singleton cluster.
